# Two implements of SSIM algorithm 
##  Usage

### Step1
Replace img1_path, img2_path to yours.

### Step2
```shell
python SSIM.py
```

Under RGB image size of 2592 Ã— 1520,
PyTorch(CPU) implement will fast two times of numpy implement.

If you use PyTorch method and you turned image tensor to tensor.Tensor.cuda, accuracy will be decrease by turn loss.
